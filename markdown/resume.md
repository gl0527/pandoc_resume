    * IDEs: Visual Studio, Vim
    * Tools: Bitbucket, Jira, Jenkins, Confluence
    * Notable projects:
        * Test-drive re-simulation: Create 3D trajectories for vehicles from GPS measurement points, and integrate them into the simulation
        * Licensing: Encrypt and license binaries using the Wibu toolchain

Jan 2020 - Aug 2021

        * Azure Kinect integration into an existing internal streaming system
        * Build 3D trajectories from 2D ArUco marker detections
        * Real-time datamatrix detection for cargo identification

Jun 2019 - Sept 2019
:   Software engineer - **Shapr3D** - *Budapest, Hungary*

    * Working on a 3D CAD software aimed for mobile devices in Swift and C++17
    * Methodology: agile
    * Platform: IPad Pro
    * IDE: XCode
    * Version control system: git
    * Other tools: Bitrise, Confluence, Figma, FireBase, Jira, Slack

Jun 2017 - Jun 2019
:   Software engineer - **Graphisoft SE** - *Budapest, Hungary*

    * Working on a 3D CAD software called ArchiCAD
    * 14+M LOC (partly legacy) C/C++ codebase
    * Methodology: waterfall
    * Platform: Windows 10, Mac
    * IDEs: Visual Studio, XCode
    * Build system: Jam
    * Version control system: Perforce
    * Debugging tools: Process Monitor, Process Explorer, DebugView, Telerik Fiddler
    * Other tools: Crucible, Jenkins, Microsoft Teams, TestTrack, Visual Assist
    * Notable projects:
        * Code coverage: I integrated a tool called CTC into our build system. Meanwhile I found some bugs in this tool and even in the MSVC compiler also.
        * Distributed build: I integrated IncrediBuild into our build system. I achieved a 66% performance boost in the build process utilizing 44 cores from our local network.
        * Telemetry: An internal tool was slow, had to figure out why. I used a thread to collect data from the tool, and another thread to periodically send the data to an internal
        server in JSON format.
        * Out-of-process crash reporting on Mac: I created a class for reading from and writing into the memory space of another process. I collected the module list
	information of the managed process, and built up a call stack from that.

Feb 2016 - Sept 2016
:   Software engineering intern - **Ericsson** - *Budapest, Hungary*

    * Performance profiling and code coverage measurement of cloud-based applications
    * Python and bash scripting
